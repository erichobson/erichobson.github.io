        inaccessible. The layers of hardware, software, and interfaces upon

            media that require specific technologies to access. As Kirschenbaum
            explains through works like Agrippa, "electronic texts do not enjoy
            a material existence in that one particularly narrow and literal
            way—you cannot reach out and touch them—that notion seems to me to
            reflect a relatively simplistic understanding of electronic media"
            (43). The materiality of digital objects means they are both easily
            replicated and uniquely fragile. Each character in a digital text is
            represented by bits; changing just one can corrupt the character
            entirely, demonstrating how digital texts are vulnerable at their
            most basic level.</p> <p class="svelte-rjm5hl">As Rothenberg succinctly puts it, "Old bit streams never die—they
            just become unreadable" (2). Rothenberg highlights the fragility of
            digital media through this fundamental paradox. The dependencies on
            hardware, software, and file formats create what he describes as
            layers where "a single break in this chain can render digital
            information inaccessible" (11). Over time, storage media degrade,
            software becomes obsolete, and interfaces evolve, making access to
            digital content increasingly precarious. Kirschenbaum argues that
            "the material complexity ... therefore underscores the need for
            critical approaches capable of accounting for such phenomena as
            multiple versions and releases, data standards, platforms, and file
            formats" (43). This demonstrates how the very mechanisms intended to
            preserve digital information can lead to its inaccessibility.</p></div> <div class="navigation-button-container svelte-rjm5hl"><button class="navigation-button svelte-rjm5hl">← Back</button></div></section>`);function se(D,R){W(R,!1);const w="What is a book?";let l=q(w),r=q([]);function E(a){return a.split("").map((i,t)=>({id:t,char:i,binary:i.charCodeAt(0).toString(2).padStart(8,"0").split(""),changed:!1,pulseColor:null}))}function G(a,i){const t=e(r)[a];t.binary[i]=t.binary[i]==="0"?"1":"0",t.changed=!0,t.pulseColor=`hsl(${Math.random()*360}, 70%, 60%)`;try{const s=String.fromCharCode(parseInt(t.binary.join(""),2));h(l,e(l).substring(0,a)+s+e(l).substring(a+1))}catch{h(l,e(l).substring(0,a)+"�"+e(l).substring(a+1))}setTimeout(()=>{t.pulseColor=null,h(r,[...e(r)])},1e3),h(r,[...e(r)])}z(()=>{h(r,E(w))}),O();var v=V(),g=y(c(v),4),b=c(g);j(b,5,()=>e(l).split(""),_,(a,i,t)=>{var s=P();let d;var f=c(s,!0);o(s),A(()=>{var m,n;d=S(s,1,"character svelte-rjm5hl",null,d,{changed:(m=e(r)[t])==null?void 0:m.changed}),$(s,`color: ${(((n=e(r)[t])==null?void 0:n.pulseColor)||"inherit")??""}`),B(f,e(i))}),p(a,s)}),o(b);var x=y(b,2);j(x,5,()=>e(r),_,(a,i,t)=>{var s=U();j(s,5,()=>e(i).binary,_,(d,f,m)=>{var n=Q();let k;var M=c(n,!0);o(n),A(()=>{k=S(n,1,"bit svelte-rjm5hl",null,k,{changed:e(i).changed}),$(n,`color: ${(e(i).pulseColor||"inherit")??""}`),B(M,e(f))}),T("click",n,()=>G(t,m)),p(d,n)}),o(s),p(a,s)}),o(x),H(2),o(g);var C=y(g,4),K=c(C);o(C),o(v),T("click",K,()=>{N.set(!0),J(`${L}/`,{replaceState:!0})}),p(D,v),F()}export{se as component};
